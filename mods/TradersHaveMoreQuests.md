A20 - Version 1.00

!WARNING - RUNS WITH EAC OFF!

This mod makes it so Traders Have more Quests in their list and also increases the range of possible locations. It increases the distance check to 1500 and 2000 meters. This mod was possible because of Bowa(Bowabb) and the .dll file they created. I thank them for creating it and allowing me to make a modlet out it!

As of right now they are 3 versions 10,15 and 20 Quests. You also can either choose from the default quest list on the Right of the screen or the Left hand of the screen.
