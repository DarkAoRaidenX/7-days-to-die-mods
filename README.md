    <h3>Installation Instructions</h3>
  </summary>
  
+ To install the mod, open the file you downloaded with an extraction tool such as [7 Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/). 
  + The folder you extracted should be called `TradersShowQuestPoiNames1.01`, now open that folder, there should be a folder inside named. 
  + Now move that folder to your `Mods` folder in your 7 Days to Die directory, if you do not have one, make one.        
+ Your directory should now look something like this: Mod folder should be only 1 Folder deep.   
```\7 Days To Die\Mods\TradersShowQuestPoiNames1.01```
+ A Wrong PathWay: 
```\7 Days To Die\Mods\ExtraFolder\TradersShowQuestPoiNames1.01```    

*Note: Due to the The Fun Pimps changing how mods are loaded, these installation instructions will change soon*
